# Car_Accident_alert_system





- Overview

A deep learning project for Real time car accident alert system through live CCTV cameras will be bulid to save lives.for resion delayed medical attention, the accident victims might die as well. As a solution to these problems, we introduce a system that detects road accidents and will provide an alert message to the most proximate control room immediately. The camera module of the system is deployed in accident-prone areas. Whenever an accident occurs, it will detect the accident and immediately report it to the nearby control room. The working of the system is based on deep learning techniques that use convolutional neural networks.




- Problem Statment 


In this fast-paced world, the number of deaths due to accidents is growing at an expeditious rate. Major reasons for these accidents are rash driving, drowsiness, drunken driving, carelessness, etc. An indicator of survival rates after detecting accidents is the time between the occurrence of accidents and the advent of medical care to the victim. The rapid growth of technology has made everything more facile and this advancement in technology additionally increased accidents.



- Data Description 


The dataset has been collected from kaggle.The Dataset has two types of labelled images Accident and Non-Accident.
